This master’s thesis, authored by Magnus Strand Harboe and Olav Gjerskvål Gilje, examines the hedging efficiency of the Rough Bergomi model compared to the Black–Scholes framework.

The aim is to determine whether using the rBergomi model provides superior risk management. Although the model is more complex, our hypothesis is that the potential improvement in managing risk justifies the added complexity.
